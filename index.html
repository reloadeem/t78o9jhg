  XZ is an anonymous organization and more I would say a gang.... However, we act for the benefit of the public. <br> We hate hatred, physical or mental violence. We may sometimes call ourselves "heroes" but not 100%.... 

We use different types of methods, in fact any method that has an effect :) <br>

We gather more and more agents willing to fight against hatred and violence. <br>You can join us by contacting @<a href="mailto:belmon@xzgn.pw">belmon </a> and going through recruitment. 

<br> You can find a list of current agents and forms of contact <a href="http://dark.xzgn.pw"> here</a>. <br> <br> <br>

Please do not troll and write out various uninteresting messages towards us. <br> <br>

  If you are a law enforcement officer or other public institution, you can see how we work [<a href="http://xz.xzgn.pw">HERE</a>]. <br> <br> <br>


Live in peace friends.
