For the sake of security and anonymity of our members, we cannot share their personal information. Such rules sorry :(.

however, we can tell you how we operate, at first we try to find out what happened, why it is so. when we know (or don't know) we first contact (if we have enough information) local law enforcement (the place where the attacker or victim is).
If we don't have much information we start investigating on our own and acquiring the most necessary data. first we try to talk to the attacker and explain the situation, if that doesn't work, we contact you, if that doesn't work either, 
we start punishing the attacker on our own, using various methods :)




contact without gpg key: legal@xzgn.pw | WE DO NOT ACCEPT REPORTS HERE ONLY CONTACT THE AUTHORITY/LAW ENFORCEMENT.
